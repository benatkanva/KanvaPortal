# Conversite CSV Format - Source of Truth

**CRITICAL: This is the ONLY data format we import. Do not use Fishbowl direct exports.**

Conversite is a data company that processes Fishbowl data and provides formatted exports for reporting and analysis.

## Key Principles

1. **Issued date is the ONLY date field used** (format: `MM-DD-YYYY HH:MM:SS`)
2. **Data is at LINE ITEM level** - each row represents one line item from a sales order
3. **Revenue is calculated by summing `Total Price` for all line items in an order**
4. **Orders can have multiple line items** (products, shipping, etc.)

## How We Use This Data

### Order Import Process
1. **Group by Sales Order ID** - Multiple line items belong to one order
2. **Create/Update Order Record**:
   - `soNumber`: From `Sales order Number`
   - `salesOrderId`: From `Sales Order ID`
   - `customerId`: From `Customer id`
   - `customerName`: From `Customer Name`
   - `postingDate`: Parsed from `Issued date`
   - `commissionMonth`: Extracted from `Issued date` (YYYY-MM format)
   - `commissionYear`: Extracted from `Issued date` (YYYY)
   - `salesPerson`: From `Sales person`
   - `salesRep`: From `Sales Rep`

3. **Create Line Item Records**:
   - `soItemId`: From `SO Item ID`
   - `salesOrderId`: From `Sales Order ID`
   - `productNum`: From `SO Item Product Number`
   - `productName`: From `Product`
   - `quantity`: From `Qty fulfilled`
   - `unitPrice`: From `Unit price`
   - `totalPrice`: From `Total Price` (**CRITICAL FOR REVENUE**)
   - `itemType`: From `Soitem type`

### Commission Calculation
1. **Load orders for commission month** (based on `Issued date`)
2. **For each order**:
   - Load all line items where `salesOrderId` matches
   - Sum `totalPrice` for all line items (excluding shipping/CC processing if configured)
   - This sum is the **order revenue** for commission calculation
3. **Match sales person to user record**
4. **Apply commission rates** based on customer type and product

### Revenue Calculation Rules
- **Sum all line items** with `Soitem type` = `Sale`
- **Exclude shipping** if configured (where `Soitem type` = `Shipping` or product contains "shipping")
- **Exclude CC processing** if configured (where product contains "cc processing")
- **Include negative line items** (credits/refunds) - they reduce the commission base

## Important Notes

1. **Do NOT use Fishbowl direct exports** - They have different column names and structure
2. **Issued date is sacred** - It's the only date that matters for commission calculation
3. **Line items are the source of truth** - Always sum line items for revenue, never use order-level totals
4. **Handle currency formatting** - `Total Price` may have $ and commas (e.g., `$3,456.00`)
5. **Multiple line items per order** - Orders typically have product lines + shipping line
